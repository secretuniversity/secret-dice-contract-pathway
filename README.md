The [SecretDice Contract Pathway](https://scrt.university/secret-dice-contract-pathway) (TBD), the beginner contract course at Secret University, is meant to showcase what's possible with privacy and randomness on Secret Network.

## Secret Dice

A simple dice roll game implemented as a Secret Contract for the Secret Network.

Launching via Gitpod will create an environment that automatically starts `localsecret` (dockerized Secret Network), 
and exposes the ports for application development.

## Connecting from outside Gitpod

To connect, prepend the port number with the gitpod url. e.g. if the workspace is at 
`https://secretunive-secretdicec-kf37podxsnu.ws-us59.gitpod.io` then you can connect to the LCD service at 
`https://1317-secretunive-secretdicec-kf37podxsnu.ws-us59.gitpod.io`.

This repo also comes with all the dependencies you need to develop Secret Contracts, and SecretCLI.
